### CIFAR-10 with Different Classifiers ###

This is a CIFAR-10 image classification problem solved with different classifiers.
Different classifiers have different accuracies.

There is a paper written in the light of this research.
The paper is in Turkish.

Classifiers Used with their max accuracies achieved:

- CNN                   86.5%
- Logistic Regression   82.9%
- MLP                   50.3%
- Random Forest         46.7%
- KNN                   38.6%
- SVM                   33.5%
- Na√Øve Bayes           29.7%
